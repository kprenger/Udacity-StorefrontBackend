# Udacity-StorefrontBackend

This project was created as part of the Udacity Full Stack JavaScript Developer Nanodegree. The intent was to create a Storefront Backend that would provide a backend to allow a front-end developer to connect to. The backend would provide the ability to manage a cart, order products, register, sign-in, etc.

See the [requirements doc](REQUIREMENTS.md) for more information on the API and Database schema. I've also included a [Postman collection](UdacityStorefrontBackend.postman_collection.json) with all routes.

## Prereqs

- Node
  - I built and tested with v17.7.1
- Docker and Docker Compose
  - I built and tested with v20.10.20

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Copy the `.env.sample` file to one called `.env.dev` and update as needed for your DEV environment. At the bare minimum, the `POSTGRES_PORT` value will need updated.
4. Copy the `.env.sample` file to one called `.env.test` and update as needed for your DEV environment. At the bare minimum, the `POSTGRES_PORT` value will need updated.
5. Run the docker-compose YAML file with your docker tool of choice (e.g. `docker-compose up -d`).
6. Run `npm run migrate` to build the needed database tables.
7. Run `npm start` to build the code and start the server.

#### Setup Notes

- The API will run on `localhost:3000`.
- The Dev DB will run on port 5432 (unless `.env.dev` is changed from the recommendation).
- The Test DB will run on port 5434 (unless `.env.test` is changed from the recommendation).
- The Dev and Test DBs are setup to run on different Docker images in the docker YAML to keep them siloed.

## Scripts

- Build and run the project with `npm start`.
- Stand up database tables in a connected Postgres DB with `npm run migrate`.
- Run tests with `npm test`.
- Compile TypeScript with `npm run build`.
- Lint with `npm run eslint`.
- Format with `npm run prettier`.
- Start the server in watch mode with `npm run watch`. This will start the server with [tsc-watch](https://github.com/gilamran/tsc-watch), so that saving changes to any files will restart the server with the new changes included.
